Combine the slimes to make them bigger!<br>
Can you skillfully combine the bouncing slimes?<br>
*This app is a parody work of "Suika Game".<br>

### Game Rules
- Put slimes in the box one by one
- Stack slimes of the same type to evolve them to the next level
- The bigger they get, the more points you earn
- If a slime drops out of the box, it's game over

Slimes bounce when they hit objects.<br>
It's up to you whether to utilize the bounce or aim for spots where they won't bounce.<br>
Try competing with players around the world on the ranking!<br>
